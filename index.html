        <h3>The existential threat. ü§Æ</h3>

        <p>The nature and pace of innovation is fundamentally changing. </p>

        <p>Enabling technologies, social changes, evolving consumer attitudes, emerging transformational technologies, and the emergence of the startup economy to finance and execute disruption are converging to put even the largest organizations at risk.</p>

        <p>The time for playing it safe is officially over. To survive and grow you have to <a href="">start thinking differently</a>.</p>

        <div class="nextprev">
          <a href="#" class="next"><img src="right.png" /></a>

      <div id="two" class="item">
        <h3>The Growth Gap. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h3>

        <p>Growth expectations are placed on companies by public and private investors. Often a gap materializes between future growth expectations and the growth it can realistically achieve from existing businesses and assets. This is exacerbated when technology is disrupting markets, consumer expectations and industry economics.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs reasonable to assume some growth will come from growth in the larger market. It‚Äôs also reasonable to assume some will come from incremental improvement.</p>

        <p>Where's the rest going to come from? Nearly all net new growth comes from disruptive innovation. To hit the growth targets you're going for, you're going to need to play by different rules. <a href="">You need to close the growth gap.</a></p>

        <h3>Traditional innovation consulting is broken. ‚ö∞Ô∏è</h3>

        <p>Most innovation consulting firms are focused on incremental gains. They employ a "land and expand" strategy looking to maximize long term revenues while minimizing risk, which disruption by definition requires. They're staffed by smart MBAs with little to no entrepreneurial experience. They run workshops and hand you decks, and wish you best of luck.</p>

        <p>DI is purpose built to be differnet. We don't optimize for utilization. We create capabilities, not just outputs. We ship products, not decks. We staff our team with hustlers, not theorists.</p>

        <p>Success for us is equiping your team to do what we do, with speed and at scale. It's products in market with viable business models and positive unit economics.</p>

        <p>Success for us is meaningful growth for you.</p>

      <div id="four" class="item">
        <h3>The opportunity: a new platform with new DNA. üß¨</h3>

        <p>Success requires the creation of a powerful platform for disruption. One designed from the ground up for the modern economy.</p>

        <p>An effective platform requires an extraordinary multi-disciplinary team. Rooted in digital, data and emerging technologies. That doesn't perceive disruption as a risk to be avoided but one an opportunity to capitalize on.</p>

        <p>This organization needs to be seperate and different from the legacy organization. Id needs a new combination of mindset, skillset, organizational makeup, and processes.</p>

        <p>DI exists to help you stand that platform up. Either by working on specific initiatives, or by introducing you to our full-fledged Venture Platform.</p>

        <p>A platform you own outright, designed to help your organization adapt to hte modern economy.</p>

        <h3>Think like a venture fund. üéØ</h3>

        <p>VCs know they have to spread their capital across 10-20 initiatives to maximize their returns. They fully expect most of their bets to go to zero. But the ones that win will be transformative.</p>

        <p>VCs raise money up front from LPs. They don't ask for incremental budgets for specific initiatives. They sell the fund, report on the fund.</p>

        <p>VCs use rigorous criteria for evaluating which companies get follow on funding.</p>

        <p>VCs don't operate the companies. The invest in smart teams and manage the portfolio.</p>

      <div id="six" class="item">
        <h3>Execution is what matters. üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h3>

        <p>Execution risk is where most internal innovation initiatives fall down.</p>
        <p>You can have the best idea in the world but not understand the nuances of what will make it successful.</p>
        <p>Knowing how and when to build the supply vs. demand sides of a marketplace. How to create an organic user generated content loop. Understanding the playbook for account based marketing. Knowing how to systematically bring a digitally native vertical brand to market.</p>

        <p>The team that understands product and distribution strategy will usually win.</p>

      <div id="seven" class="item">
        <h3>It's not just about going from zero to one. üé¢</h3>

        <p>Most innovation initiatives are obsessed with the beginning. Surfacing ideas. Doing design thinking exercises. Running hackathons.</p>
        <p>But ideas don't equal growth.</p>
        <p>DI is aggressive about turning ideas into prototypes and prototypes into MVPs. We obsess over achieving Product-Market fit and identifying channels to rapidly scale.</p>
